		<h2>What is FIRE Stories? </h2>
		<p>FIRE (Financial Independence Early Retirement) Stories is where we interview normal people just like you who've achevied financial independence and have retired early. </p>
		<p>In each interview we discuss how they got where they are today, what mistakes they made, and advice on how to start adopting the FIRE mindset.</p>

		<h2>What's the big deal?</h2>
		<p>More and more people are beginning to question the standard consumer mindset of more debt, more things - work, house, kids, retire at 65, die. Instead they are making decisions
			that allow them the freedom to choose how they want to spend their time. Most people don't actually 'retire', but simply make decisions that give them more choices. And sometimes that means
			not working ever again.
